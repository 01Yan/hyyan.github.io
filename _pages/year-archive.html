<p>I have a great passion for travel and exploring nature🌃. I’ve visited 19 countries so far, immersing myself in different cultures and experiencing unforgettable moments like glacier trekking🧊🏔️. These experiences have broadened my horizons and helped me gain a clearer sense of my inner thoughts and desires.</p>

<p>I'm also a big fan of exercise! I have received professional table tennis training🏓️ and am also interested in fitness and surfing🏄‍♀️. These activities not only make me stronger, but also give me a more positive attitude in life and work.</p>

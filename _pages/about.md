I recently graduated with dual Bachelor's degree from Xidian University and Heriot-Watt University and am currently on a gap year. My research interests lie at the intersection of AI and scientific applications, focusing on Graph Neural Networks, algorithmic optimization, force fields, and network optimization. I am now exploring new research directions, potentially within AI or related fields, before pursuing graduate studies. Feel free to reach out to me for collaboration or discussion.

You can find my CV here: [Hongyu Yan's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV-Hongyu Yan.pdf).

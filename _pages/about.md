I recently graduated with dual Bachelor's degree from Xidian University and Heriot-Watt University and am currently on a gap year. My research interests lie at the intersection of AI and scientific applications, focusing on Graph Neural Networks, algorithmic optimization, force fields, and network optimization. I am now exploring new research directions, potentially within AI or related fields, before pursuing graduate studies. Feel free to reach out to me for collaboration or discussion.

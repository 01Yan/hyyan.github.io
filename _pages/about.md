I recently graduated with dual Bachelor's degree from Xidian University and Heriot-Watt University and am currently on a gap year. My research interests center on exploring the applications of machine learning in practical scenarios, focusing on graph neural networks, large language models, materials discovery, and computational chemistry. I am currently applying to PhD programs and aspire to explore diverse fields related to AI in the future. Feel free to reach out to me for collaboration or discussion.

I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech, starting in Spring 2026. I received my B.Eng. degree from Xidian University in 2024. My research interests center on the applications of machine learning in practical scenarios, focusing on graph neural networks, large language models, materials discovery, and computational chemistry. Recently, I have also been exploring AI Agents and AI Safety. Feel free to reach out for collaboration or discussion.
